Geometric Algebra (GA) library. The public API was inspired by that of [Grassmann.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl).

This package is currently in heavy development. The source code and public API may change at any moment. Use at your own risk. General users may want to consider using [Grassmann.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl) instead. It is an AGPL-licensed GA library that is more stable and feature complete.
